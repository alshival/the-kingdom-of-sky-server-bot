# Discord Bot for Sky: Children of the Light

SkyBot is a Discord bot designed to provide information about the game Sky: Children of the Light. It includes features such as shard eruption times and the ability to automatically clean out a specified text channel before the daily reset, allowing for the organization of webhook messages from the Sky: Infographics Database server's `#daily-quest` channel on your server daily.

Note: The infographics, as well as the shard prediction algorithm, was provided and translated from javascript code written by [Plutoy](https://github.com/PlutoyDev/sky-shards).

## Features

- **Shard Eruption Information:** Get information about the shard of the day, including details about red and black shards, their realms, maps, and reward Ascended Candles.

- **Next Shards:** Retrieve information about the next upcoming shards, either red or black, with details on their occurrence dates and maps.

- **Daily Quest Channel Cleanup:** Automatically clear out a specified text channel before the daily reset to organize prior day webhook messages.
